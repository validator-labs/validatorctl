The `validatorctl` relies on a few binaries that you'll need to ensure you have installed:
- Docker v24.0.6+
- Helm v3.14.0+
- Kind v0.20.0+
- Kubectl v1.24.10+

## Setup

### Binary Installation

You can download the `validatorctl` binary you require directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/validator-labs/validatorctl/releases) or via curl.
For instance, the v0.0.1 darwin binary can be installed and run like this:

```sh
curl -L -O https://github.com/validator-labs/validatorctl/releases/download/v0.0.1/validator-darwin-arm64
chmod +x validator-darwin-arm64
sudo mv validator-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/validator
validator help
```

### Building from Source

To build `validatorctl` from source, you'll need to ensure you're running `go1.22.4`.
You can then build `validatorctl` and run it with the following commands:

```sh
make build-cli
./bin/validator help
```

## Usage
`validatorctl` provides several commands for managing validator plugins. Below are some common commands:
- Install validator plugins with the `validator install` command.
- Describe validation results with the `validator describe` command.
- Re-configure validator plugins after they've been installed with the `validator upgrade` command.
- Uninstall the validator and all plugins with the `validator uninstall` command.
